The fragments list the actual organs involved in digestion."
Why does ice float on water?,,"1. Ice floats because it is less dense than liquid water.\n2. When water freezes, its molecules arrange in a crystalline structure that takes up more space.\n3. This structure makes ice less dense, so it floats.",Ice sinks because it is heavier than liquid water.,Incorrect,"The answer states that ice sinks because it is heavier than liquid water, which contradicts the fragments that explain why ice floats due to its lower density. The answer is incorrect as it does not align with the supporting fragments."
